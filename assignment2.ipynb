Leigh - Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors , suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in . \" Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators , for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are , after all , the proprietors of the company ,\" Leigh - Pemberton said . He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said .

K . GROWING IMPATIENT WITH JAPAN - THATCHER Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the U . K . Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets . She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL . L > to enter the Japanese telecommunications market was being regarded by her government as a test case . \" I wrote to the prime minister of Japan , Mr Nakasone , on the fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and Wireless bid . I have not yet had a reply . We see this as a test on how open the Japanese market really is ,\" Thatcher said . Thatcher told Parliament that \" shortly ... We shall have more powers than we have now , when , for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available , then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do .\" Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa . But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company .  \n",

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S . Automaker , has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC ' s profitable Jeep business and dealers , as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea , Ontario . That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts . AMC ' s Toledo , Ohio Jeep plant has 1 , 850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while its Kenosha , Wisconsin , car plant has another 2 , 250 on layoff .  \n",

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner .

He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said . Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S .

That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts .

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner . Leigh - Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors , suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in . \" Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators , for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are , after all , the proprietors of the company ,\" Leigh - Pemberton said . He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said . Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL .

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S . Automaker , has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC ' s profitable Jeep business and dealers , as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea , Ontario . That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts . AMC ' s Toledo , Ohio Jeep plant has 1 , 850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while its Kenosha , Wisconsin , car plant has another 2 , 250 on layoff .   \n",

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner .

Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

Automaker , has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC ' s profitable Jeep business and dealers , as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea , Ontario . That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts . AMC ' s Toledo , Ohio Jeep plant has 1 , 850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while its Kenosha , Wisconsin , car plant has another 2 , 250 on layoff .</td>\n",

He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said . Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL .

We shall have more powers than we have now , when , for example the powers under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become available , then we shall be able to take action in cases where other countries do not offer the same full access to financial services as we do .\" Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa . But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless having a managerial role in the new company .  \n",

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S . Automaker , has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC ' s profitable Jeep business and dealers , as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea , Ontario . That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts . AMC ' s Toledo , Ohio Jeep plant has 1 , 850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while its Kenosha , Wisconsin , car plant has another 2 , 250 on layoff .  \n",

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner .

He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said . Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S .

That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts .

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner . Leigh - Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties with institutional investors , suggesting representatives of those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors of companies they invest in . \" Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators , for that is but a short step from saying that they should be protected from their own shareholders -- who are , after all , the proprietors of the company ,\" Leigh - Pemberton said . He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to play in furthering economies of scale , integration and more efficient market penetration . \" The degree of success or failure ( of a takeover ) has not in my experience depended on whether or not the takeover was contested ,\" he said . Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .

She told Parliament that the bid by the U . K .' s Cable and Wireless Plc & lt ; CAWL .

Analysts said the merger is virtually certain to go ahead . American Motors directors met for five hours Wednesday to review the takeover proposal . \" The board ... Expects to be meeting periodically over the next several weeks on the Chrysler proposal ,\" AMC said in its first formal statement since it acknowledged the Chrysler proposal on Monday . Chrysler , the number three U . S . Automaker , has said the merger is motivated principally by its desire to acquire AMC ' s profitable Jeep business and dealers , as well as a new modern car assembly plant in Bramalea , Ontario . That means a guaranteed future for much of AMC , but it leaves in question the fate of many of its 19 , 000 - plus employees , according to industry analysts . AMC ' s Toledo , Ohio Jeep plant has 1 , 850 hourly workers on indefinite layoff while its Kenosha , Wisconsin , car plant has another 2 , 250 on layoff .   \n",

Instead , merchant banks advising bidding companies must show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that have marred recent takeovers , he told the Yorkshire and Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries ' annual dinner .

Leigh - Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover activity in the recent past . \" The aim is to pressurise a company ' s management into action dedicated solely to a favourable impact on the share price in the short - term , partly or even primarily at the expense of the future ,\" he said . Such bids \" often depend for their success on creating a highly - charged and artificial situation in the share market , and give rise to temptations , on both sides of the battle , to engage in aggressive , even manipulative tactics that are immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders ,\" he said .
